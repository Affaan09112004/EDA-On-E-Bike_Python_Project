## 📂 Overview

This project dives into **real-world E-Bike trip data** to uncover patterns and insights using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** in Python. The aim is to understand user behaviors, trip patterns, and bike usage trends for both Subscribers and Customers.

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Steps

- Removed irrelevant or empty columns.
- Converted trip duration from seconds to **minutes (rounded to 2 decimal places)**.
- Extracted new features:
  - **Time of Day** (Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night)
  - **Day of the Week**
  - **Week Type** (Weekday or Weekend)

---

## 📊 Visualizations Used

Built with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**:
- Bar Charts
- Box Plots
- Pie Charts
- Scatter Plots
- Violin Plots

---

## 🔍 Key Findings

### 📅 Trip Patterns by User Type
- **Subscribers** take more trips **on weekdays**, indicating daily commutes (like office or college).
- **Customers** take more trips **on weekends**, likely for leisure or exploration.
- Weekday usage is dominated by subscribers; weekend usage by customers.

### ⏱ Duration-Based Insights
- **Weekday trips are shorter**, aligned with regular commutes.
- **Weekend trips are longer**, suggesting casual or sightseeing rides.

### ⏰ Time of Day Trends
- **Morning** has the highest number of trips — consistent with start-of-day routines.
- **Evening** has the longest **average trip duration**.
- Very few trips occur **at night**.

### 🚲 Bike Usage
- Certain bikes are used more frequently than others — likely stationed in high-demand areas.
